# ðŸ“¦ Devell Dependency Injection Library

## What is this?

This is another library for typescript, written to be as easy to use as possible.

It has (or will have) possibilities that should improve your programming experience vastly,
but gathering all the best solutions I learned on my software development journey, and decide
to filter, simplify, and pack into one `simple API` library.

The first thing to do when using it is to create a `Container` class instance.

Then there will come a series of packages that I want to use to stand out for my commercial
customers.

## Show me the code

This is just the simplest snippet:

```
import { Container } from "@container/container";
import { Logger } from "@logger/logger";
import { Injectable } from "@container/decorators/injectable";

const container = new Container();

container.register("logger", Logger);

@Injectable()
class InvoiceRegistry {
    constructor(public logger: Logger) {}
}

container.register("invoice-registry", InvoiceRegistry);

const invoiceRegistry = container.resolve("invoice-registry");
invoiceRegistry.logger.log("It is working.");

```

## Current state

For now, there is a requirement to add a `@Injectable()` decorator to the class
that we want to have autowired.

This is a very early version and a lot will be added.

I'm planning to incorporate the Typescript Compiler API.
